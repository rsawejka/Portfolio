<div id="selfIntroText"> I am a web developer with 5 years+ of experiance. For me coding is a fun way for me to push my self to continually keep learning. 
        I am always excited to take on new tasks as they are an oppertunity to learn more. I thrive the most when I am being challanged, when I am challanged I am very determined and excited to figure out the solution. 
        Even when I am being challanged I make sure I am still paying close attention to the small deatils to ensure quailty. Currently I am a web developer at the Humane Animal Welfare Society in Waukesha, WI. 
        I like being able to be creative in helping create new ways to get more animals adoped faster! I am also able to help create new ways to even improve animal health.
